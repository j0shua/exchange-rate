AppNexus Web Service Take Home Test:

Write a restful web-service called exchange-rate to retrieve exchange rates for different currencies.

Clients are authorized to access the service by passing authorization token provided offline in the header (-H "Authorization:  2fad387d7as77ddab")

Initially this service will only support HTTP GET , but going forward we will allow POST/PUT/DELETE as well. 

Exchange rates are stored in  a table called exchange_rate in db, this table contains conversion rates from US dollar.

exchange_rate table defintion:
currency  char(3) -- EUR, JPY etc..
conversion_rate decimal(12,6)
as_of  datetime    -- external timestamp for last_updated
deleted tinyint(1)
last_modified   timestamp -- current_timestamp

exchange-rate service will allow users to:
* retrieve rates for one or multiple currencies.
* filter result based on as_of date. (so they only see rates for a particular day)
* limit  to 100 GET requests per minute per user

You can assume that apc and memcached are installed on the server.  and please provide db schema for exchange_rate table.
